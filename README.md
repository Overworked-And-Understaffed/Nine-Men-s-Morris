This is an abstract stategy board game with two players.

Each player has 9 pieces to bring to a total of 18 pieces.

The goal is to get your opponent down to only having two pieces left. To accomplish this, you want to get a string of three of your pieces on one line (a "mill"). By forming a mill, you can then remove one of your opponent's pieces from the board. 

There are multiple phases to the game:
1. The "Placing Pieces" Phase: This phase allows you and your opponent to, in turns, place all of your pieces on the board. 
2. The "Moving Pieces" Phase: Once all of the pieces are placed on the board, both you and your opponent try to move your pieces into mills to remove your opponents pieces. During this phase, you can only move your pieces to any places on the board ajacent to where your piece currently is that also has no other pieces placed there. 
3. The "Flying" Phase: When either you or your opponent is down to three pieces, on their turn, that player can move their pieces anywhere on the board where there is not already another piece.
